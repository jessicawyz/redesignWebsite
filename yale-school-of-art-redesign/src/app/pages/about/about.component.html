    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      The Yale School of Art is a graduate school that confers MFAs in Graphic Design, Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture; and offers undergraduate-level art courses to Yale College students. Our website exists as an ongoing collaborative experiment in digital publishing and information sharing. It functions as a wikiâ€”all members of the School of Art community have the ability to add new, and edit most existing content.
